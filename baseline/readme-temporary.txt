Produce comment-reply pairs.

We should probably have only 1 reply per comment, even though many single comments might have many replies, we should really just go with one. We can either go with the first one, or we can go with the top-voted one.

The database stores the parent_id, comment_id, the parent comment, the reply, subreddit, the time and the score(votes) for the comment.
