# Chatbot Baseline

## 1. Data Process

- The reddit datasets are downloaded from [Reddit](http://files.pushshift.io/reddit/comments/). They are all json objects.

- I just chose one month 'RC_2015-05.bz2' data for baseline, the size of this dataset is 33,46 GB after decompression but before processing it. But you don't need to decompress it.



## 2. Create Training and Testing Data

## 3. Build encoder-decoder model with Attention Mechanism for Chatbot.
