Holy shit, I couldn't tell if some of those scenes were sped up or they were actually moving that fast. I need to watch more Martial Arts movies!
I'll admit I hadn't seen most of those films either but form what I've watched in the last few days Moon Lee was amazing.

Would you like more salt on that rant?
The chicken deleted the salty rant. Can you elaborate on what said faggot did write?
===
It said it needed to reboot the one time, not sure if it's everytime.
Reboot is not required on Pi. After install, dismiss the reboot prompt; the app should appear in the dropdown list and can be launched imediatelly.

===

===
That is freaking sick but looks expensive. It's most likely made by Garena. I like how GGG puts everything into game play rather than fancy cut scenes.
Yeah its pretty awesome that Garena is willing to spend the big bux on these so GGG doesn't have to.

I'm not a Christian I'm agnostic

That's it, people. Thread's over. We can all go home now.
===
Wow. Those are some great words.
Just speaking from experience, I'm an expert on not being motivated haha

I know, just looking a bit feeble. Things will change.
Our approach looks much better. Granted no success yet, but we're making him work
===
Bitcoiners love the free market. But only when it doesn't work against them.
Patents are inherently not free market. Patents require government force.
===
Basketball IQ is a thing though, unrelated to actual IQ. There isn't necessarily any correlation.
Example: Rondo has a high basketball IQ, but he also thinks Connect Four iis a highly strategic game.

Oh I got a pm this morning asking me about prison breaks... my bad.
Not to worry. I'll go read Prison Breaks, then send you that pm and all will be well.

Quick: What do you think that lord's views on open relationships are?
Feather: Don't know, don't really care.
Quick: Right, well, I'm gonna go hang out with the girls for a bit, get out of your mane.
Feather: Alright, tell 'em I said hi.
Quick: Hey, we're going to have at least an angel and a holy dragon there.
Soft: And a Changeling, a Diamond Dog, maybe a Minotaur, and -- Honey: We get it.
Quick: At the very least, it's going to be interesting.
Soft: I hope so. Honey: You have an odd definition of interesting.
Quick: You kind of have to with myself and Feather around.
Silver: True. Soft: The dude's been three different species now, what's next? Honey: Griffon? Soft: You'd like that.
Quick: If anything, probably so she could see his scars again.
Honey: W-what?! Uh, I mean, you see... Soft: We're messing with you.
Quick: Oh? And how would you like me to make it up to you?
Honey: You'll see when we get home.
Quick: Ooh, I like it when you get all supervillainy.
Soft: Now I want to see what she has planned!
Quick: A race it is, then.
Honey: First one there get's to pick the toy.
Quick: Gotta go fast, Hon.
Honey: I am... keeping up...
Quick: Let's see what's on offer.
Honey: I got one of each size, including the Dragon, which was going to be my choice.
Quick: Yeah, that would have put me in the hospital. Let's go with the medium Griffon.
Honey: You do realize that one has the knot and pump, right?
Quick: Need to get used to it some time.
Honey: Alright, well, let's get to it.
Quick: Any way you can get it out?
Honey: I can try and pull it out, but that could result in... things.
Quick: Well, that beats having it stuck in me. Do it.
Honey: Okay, on three. One... THREE!
Quick: Granted, you also don't have a penis, you can't control it quite as much.
Honey: Well, I did that one time...
Quick: No way in Tartarus you're sticking it in me if it's the size it was last time.
Honey: Maybe she can make it smaller?
Quick: You better believe it. You, me, Silver, Soft, and Ali.
Honey: It's going to be amazing.
Tyrus: Yes, it's a shame things like that don't occur as much anymore.
Nelly: So, how long are you going to stay?
Tyrus: You're welcome to visit any time.
Yalaa: Thank you. Nelly: It's still amazing seeing you.
Tyrus: Why thank you, young ones. It feels good to be appreciated like this at my age.
Nelly: I'm sure anyone would be amazed at the sight of you.
Tyrus: Unfortunately, most are usually just terrified. I still consider it a miracle that the Farasi and I are on speaking terms.
Nelly: Well, you have Quick to thank for that.
Tyrus: Mostly the two Farasi themselves, I'd say.
Nelly: Well, Quick started the relations with the Farasi to begin with.
Tyrus: They were our prey for several thousand years. They only recently moved to their new home in the Badlands.
Nelly: Prey? But they're bigger than me!
Tyrus: He's leading the whole thing, so I'd suggest speaking with him.
Nelly: Alright, we'll go do that. Thank you for talking with us.

I agree with everything you said except for the first one. I'd expand it more to be just well-written characters in general.
They can't just perfectly slot into character tropes otherwise they'd be a bit too generic and boring, they need to develop throughout the course of the show.
===
I have three controllers, two have very loud bumpers, one has nice and quite ones, its my favorite!
Is the quiet one a newer controller purchased recently or anything?
===
There's a few different devices out there that can override anti-theft systems. It's how thieves will sometimes open exotic cars

Cucumbers are cheaper and taste ok to me.
But they're like totally different. I can't see a scenario where you could swap a cucumber for a zucchini or vice versa and have it come out ok.
Maybe not every recipe, but they're fine for stir fry or soup.
I can't think of any soups or stir fries that I'd ever want to put cucumber in.
Have you tried it though? I've used cucumbers just the same as zucchini in a stir fry and you'd never know the difference when eating it.
I can't say I have! I'll give it a try next time I make a stir fry.
===
It looks like you can use the code to download the intro song and ending song from Tales Channel Plus if you have an account.

That was very brave of you to admit because people really hate Pearl now.
===
It feels like black people are the most racist. But they got plot armor on so no one can speak out against it.
Its been my experience that any sort of criticism of a person of color will get the race card tossed your way.
===
Both Lysandre? Or is there one left?
I'm sorry I have one left.
===

I don't know. Didn't flatter me? Yeah, sounds right.
I tried! It was a good effort. That should count for something.
You're right. I'll tell him to use your tears as lube.
And this is why it's so hard to say something nice to you. I take back my goats.
I was helping you suffer less and this is how you repay me?!
You're the one who refused the offer!
Perhaps, in another time, in another place, I would have called you friend. Here, in this time, it is not to be... Bend over.
